This package includes the source codes and datasets used in this research project. We encourage the reader to review the submitted paper.

The complete software list and requirements are included in the file "Requirements.txt".

Since the methodology was tested on three different US States (California, Pennsylvania and Texas) we include three folders in this package. Each folder contains the datasets for each variable used in the paper.

Results are reproducible just by running python source code: Source_Code.py
