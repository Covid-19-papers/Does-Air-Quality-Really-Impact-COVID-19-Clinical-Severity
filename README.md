This package includes the source codes and datasets used in this research project. We encourage the reader to review the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3447548.3467207) presented in [KDD 2021](https://kdd.org/kdd2021/).

The complete software list and requirements are included in the file "Requirements.txt".

Since methodology was tested on three different US States (California, Pennsylvania and Texas), we include three folders in this package. Each folder contains the datasets of each variable used in the paper.

Results are reproducible by running python source code: Source_Code.py
