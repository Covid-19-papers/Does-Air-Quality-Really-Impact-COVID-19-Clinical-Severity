Recurrent Graph Neural Network on COVID-19 and NASA Satellite data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our source code was developed using the following list of software.  

1) * Python *
We uses python 3.7.5 in several source codes, also we have tested such scripts in the latest python version 3.8.3.
We use common libraries such as: numpy, matplotlib, os, glob, datetime; and additional libraries as described below.

2) * PyTorch *
An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. 
https://pytorch.org

3) * PyTorch Geometric *
PyTorch Geometric is a geometric deep learning extension library for PyTorch.

2) * PyTorch Geometric Temporal*
PyTorch Geometric Temporal is an temporal graph neural network extension library for PyTorch Geometric. It builds on open-source deep-learning and graph processing libraries. PyTorch Geometric Temporal consists of state-of-the-art deep learning and parametric learning methods to process spatio-temporal signals. https://pytorch-geometric-temporal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
